# RoomCounter
In-Development Project to count the number of people in a given space


This project is inteded to brainstorm and hopefully prototype and build a system to count the number of students/people currently occupying a given room to help ensure safety. 

# Current Issues:
* How to count people
* Centralized sensor vs. Mesh-Network
* Room/Building Wide Counting
  * If room count is wanted, how to we set which sensors are a part of a given room?
